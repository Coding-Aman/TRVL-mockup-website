Built this website in React using React Hooks and React Router. Created a travel design and aded a video background as well as an image background. This is created using reusable card components as well that we can pass in custom data. Feel free to refactor my code and make it better. The cards created  in this website are reusable and receive data that we pass through them. This means we could generate 1000's of these cards without having to hard code each of them.
